The project involves developing an Android mobile application for a training center. The app will have three user roles: admin, trainee (student), and instructor. Admin can manage courses, instructors, and students. Trainees can apply for courses, view course history, and receive notifications. Instructors can view their schedule and students in their courses. The app requires signup, login, and logout functionalities, and a creative design is expected.
